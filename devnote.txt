Electron + React + Webpack

Electron's entry point is a javascript (not html) pointed by 'main' attribute in package.json - normally main.js.
This 'electron main process' javascript is provided to electron runtime in a variety of ways:

./node_modules/.bin/electron *.js
./node_modules/.bin/electron . (looks for main script attribute in package.json file in the current directory)
./node_modules/.bin/electron (open it manually from the electron launcher)

In turn 'electron render process' is invoked by the main process by referencing a html entry point (mainWindow.loadURL).
This html entry point is analogous to an html loaded into a browser. In this project, renderer.js is loaded with a
script tag. But this javascript file is used as the entry point to Webpack, and consequently './dist/app.js' is loaded.

That is:

main.js: electron main process entry point
index.html: electron renderer process entry point
renderer.js: electron renderer process which is the root of webpack build process
