Electron + React + Webpack

Electron's entry point is a javascript (not html) pointed by 'main' attribute in package.json - normally main.js.
This 'electron main process' javascript is provided to electron runtime in a variety of ways:

./node_modules/.bin/electron *.js
./node_modules/.bin/electron . (looks for main script attribute in package.json file in the current directory)
./node_modules/.bin/electron (open it manually from the electron launcher)

In turn 'electron render process' is invoked by the main process by referencing a html entry point (mainWindow.loadURL).
This html entry point is analogous to an html loaded into a browser. In this project, render.js (electron render process)
is loaded with a script tag. But this javascript file is used as the entry point to Webpack, and consequently
'./dist/app.js' is loaded which contains the render process.

That is:

main.js: electron main process entry point (via package.json 'main' attribute)
index.html: electron renderer process entry point (via mainWindow.loadURL() in main.js)
render.js: electron renderer process which is the root of webpack build process (via script tag in index.html - webpack produced ./dist/app.js)

To start the app run "npm start"
